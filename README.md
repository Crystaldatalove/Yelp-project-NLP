# Yelp-project-NLP

Objective: we want to predict number of Yelp star ratings based on reviews by using Natural Language Processing. 

Code: Day 9 Yelp project NLP.ipynb notebook file.

Dataset: yelp.csv

Workflow: 

•Tokenization

•CountVectorizer

•N-grams

•Using Naive Bayes to predict the star ratings

•Defining a function that accepts a vectorizer and calculates the accuracy

•Stopword removal

•Remove English stop words and only keep 100 features

•including 1-grams and 2-grams, and only including terms that appear at least twice

•TextBlob

•Stemming and Lemmatization

•Using TF-IDF to summarize a yelp review

•Sentimental analysis: text classification model


Result: box plot of sentiment grouped by stars
